## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**controller** | **str** | Controller is the name of the DRA driver that is meant to handle allocation of this claim. If empty, allocation is handled by the scheduler while scheduling a pod.  Must be a DNS subdomain and should end with a DNS domain owned by the vendor of the driver.  This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DRAControlPlaneController feature gate. | [optional]
