# V1beta2LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration

LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration specifies how to handle requests that are subject to limits. It addresses two issues:   - How are requests for this priority level limited?   - What should be done with requests that exceed the limit?

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**assured_concurrency_shares** | **int** | &#x60;assuredConcurrencyShares&#x60; (ACS) configures the execution limit, which is a limit on the number of requests of this priority level that may be exeucting at a given time.  ACS must be a positive number. The server&#39;s concurrency limit (SCL) is divided among the concurrency-controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares. This produces the assured concurrency value (ACV) --- the number of requests that may be executing at a time --- for each such priority level:              ACV(l) &#x3D; ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )  bigger numbers of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every other PL). This field has a default value of 30. | [optional] 
**borrowing_limit_percent** | **int** | &#x60;borrowingLimitPercent&#x60;, if present, configures a limit on how many seats this priority level can borrow from other priority levels. The limit is known as this level&#39;s BorrowingConcurrencyLimit (BorrowingCL) and is a limit on the total number of seats that this level may borrow at any one time. This field holds the ratio of that limit to the level&#39;s nominal concurrency limit. When this field is non-nil, it must hold a non-negative integer and the limit is calculated as follows.  BorrowingCL(i) &#x3D; round( NominalCL(i) * borrowingLimitPercent(i)/100.0 )  The value of this field can be more than 100, implying that this priority level can borrow a number of seats that is greater than its own nominal concurrency limit (NominalCL). When this field is left &#x60;nil&#x60;, the limit is effectively infinite. | [optional] 
**lendable_percent** | **int** | &#x60;lendablePercent&#x60; prescribes the fraction of the level&#39;s NominalCL that can be borrowed by other priority levels. The value of this field must be between 0 and 100, inclusive, and it defaults to 0. The number of seats that other levels can borrow from this level, known as this level&#39;s LendableConcurrencyLimit (LendableCL), is defined as follows.  LendableCL(i) &#x3D; round( NominalCL(i) * lendablePercent(i)/100.0 ) | [optional] 
**limit_response** | [**V1beta2LimitResponse**](V1beta2LimitResponse.md) |  | [optional]
